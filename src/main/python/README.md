This folder holds python source code.
Recommendations: 
- Use minimum of python 3.10.4 as host OS should be at least Ubuntu 22.4 based on ITAInnova requirements.
  [State of Python on Ubuntu version](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/Ubuntu2204PythonState#:~:text=Ubuntu%2022.04%20comes%20with%20Python%203.10.)
- In general, do not use any library with a release version number smaller than 1.00, no alpha, no beta versions except for research purposes. Never on deployment in production scopes. Review the health of the library before daring to use it.
